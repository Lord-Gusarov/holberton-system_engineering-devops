## Task
The web stack you are debugging today is a Wordpress website running on a LAMP stack.
* Using strace, find out why Apache is returning a 500 error. Once you find the issue, fix it and then automate it using Puppet (instead of using Bash as you were previously doing).
	* File: [0-strace_is_your_friend.pp](0-strace_is_your_friend.pp)
